# Image Caption Generator

## Overview

The Image Caption Generator is an advanced deep learning project that combines the formidable capabilities of the VGG16 and LSTM algorithms in Python to create captivating captions for images. This project is a testament to the power of artificial intelligence in understanding and describing images, even in the case of challenging datasets.

## Features

- **VGG16 and LSTM Combination:** The project harnesses the strength of the VGG16 and LSTM deep learning algorithms to generate descriptive captions for images.

- **User-Friendly Web Application:** We've designed and implemented a user-friendly web application using Flask and HTML, providing a seamless experience for users to upload their images and instantly receive captivating captions.

- **Successful Training on an 8K Dataset:** The model has been successfully trained on a challenging 8K dataset, showcasing AI's ability to understand and describe a wide range of images effectively.
- If you are interested in the model trained on the 30K dataset (with the caveat that it may not be easily trainable on standard platforms), open `caption_generator.ipynb`.
